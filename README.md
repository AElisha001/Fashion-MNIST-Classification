# Fashion-MNIST-Classification

---

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Python using TensorFlow/Keras to classify clothing images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images representing 10 categories such as shirts, trousers, sneakers, and bags. The code includes data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation, with accuracy and loss metrics visualized to track learning progress. This project provides a simple and effective baseline for beginners exploring image classification with deep learning.
